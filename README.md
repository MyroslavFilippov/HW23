Comparing various backup methods—Full, Incremental, Differential, Reverse Delta, and Continuous Data Protection (CDP)—involves evaluating their parameters such as size, ability to roll back to a specific time point, speed of rollback, and cost. Here’s a detailed comparison:

### **1. Full Backup**

**Size:**

Largest, as it copies all data every time.
Ability to Roll Back to Specific Time Point:

Possible, but only to the points where full backups were taken.

**Speed of Rollback:**

Moderate to slow, depending on the database size, as the entire database needs to be restored.

**Cost:**

High due to storage needs and time required to create the backup.

### **2. Incremental Backup**

**Size:**

Smallest, as only changes since the last backup are saved.
Ability to Roll Back to Specific Time Point:

High, can roll back to any incremental backup point.

**Speed of Rollback:**

Slow, as it requires the last full backup and all subsequent incremental backups to restore.

**Cost:**

Moderate, as it requires less storage but more complex restoration processes.

### 3. Differential Backup

**Size:**

Larger than incremental but smaller than full, as it copies all changes since the last full backup.
Ability to Roll Back to Specific Time Point:

Moderate, can roll back to the last differential backup point.

**Speed of Rollback:**

Faster than incremental but slower than full, as it requires only the last full backup and the latest differential backup.

**Cost:**

Moderate to high, depending on the frequency of differential backups and storage used.

### **4. Reverse Delta Backup**

**Size:**

Moderate, as it stores reverse changes from a known good state (usually a full backup).
Ability to Roll Back to Specific Time Point:

High, similar to incremental, can roll back to any point where reverse deltas exist.

**Speed of Rollback:**

Fast, because you apply reverse changes to the latest state.

**Cost:**

Moderate, balancing between storage efficiency and quick restoration.

### **5. Continuous Data Protection (CDP)**

**Size:**

Potentially large, as it continuously tracks changes.
Ability to Roll Back to Specific Time Point:

Very high, can roll back to any point in time.

**Speed of Rollback:**


Very fast, as it provides granular rollback capabilities.

**Cost:**

Very high, due to the need for continuous tracking, significant storage, and sophisticated technology.
